# Collector Worker

M2a has a deterministic fixture runner in `geno_core.collection` and fixture adapters in
`geno_core.collectors`. They implement the same `CollectorBackend` contract expected by real
platform adapters, so tests can verify AnswerRun, RawAnswer, citations, evidence assets, cost, and
AuditEvent without external API credentials.

P0a adapters:

- Implemented for contract testing: `FixturePerplexitySonarCollector`, `FixtureOpenAIWebSearchCollector`
- Implemented real API adapter shells: `PerplexitySonarCollector`, `OpenAIWebSearchCollector`

Local fixture slice:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=packages/geno_core:apps/api python3 workers/collector_worker/run_collection_slice.py --mode fixture
```

API adapter slice:

```bash
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
PYTHONPATH=packages/geno_core:apps/api python3 workers/collector_worker/run_collection_slice.py --mode api
```

If API keys are missing, the worker returns `CollectionFailureRecord` items and writes
`answer_run_failed` audit events instead of pretending collection succeeded.

P0b planned adapters:

- `PlaywrightGoogleAIOCollector`
- `PlaywrightAIModeCollector`
- `ThirdPartySerpCollector`
- `ManualBackfillCollector`
